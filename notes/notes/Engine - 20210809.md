Attempt 1 at a simple 2d framework based on c++, lua and opengl

libraries:
	meson - build system
	entt - try out a fully fledged ecs setup
	sdl - cross-platform windowing library with gl context
	glad - gl functions
	glm - math
	luajit - behaviour scripts
	
goal for structure:
	A game has one or more scenes.
		- A scene is a container for the current game state
			- contains entities in the scene (entt::registry)
			- handles updating state and drawing
				- this is delegated to systems which acts upon the registry
			- does whatever is necessary for loading and initializating content
				- this could be scene definitions in xml
					- this would include entity definitions and ressources names
					- behaviour scripts?

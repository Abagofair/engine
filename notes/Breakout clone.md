Must:
	Multiple point/boost/whatever blocks
	Two player blocks (one for each analog controller or custom key binds)
	A background of some sort
	Basic text
	
Want:
	Particle effects
	
Initial SpriteRenderer:
	Support for instanced rendering.
		I want all the point blocks to at least render the same quad with different textures and transform.
		
	Player Rendering could also be instanced along with the point blocks
